# CRD vendoring workflow

The `crds/` layer vendors three upstream CRD bundles via vendir (config in `vendir.yml` at the repo root):

- **cert-manager** (`githubRelease`, pinned tag) — single release artifact `cert-manager.crds.yaml`. Referenced directly from `crds/kustomization.yaml`.
- **cloudnative-pg** (`git`, pinned tag) — only `config/crd/bases/**` is synced (upstream `kustomization.yaml` ships dead-code patch references). A local `crds/cloudnative-pg/kustomization.yaml` lists the 10 CRD files explicitly.
- **gateway-api** (`git`, pinned tag) — `config/crd/**` minus `experimental/**`. Upstream `kustomization.yaml` is kept and used directly via `crds/kustomization.yaml` → `gateway-api/upstream`.

When bumping any of these versions:

1. Bump the `tag` (or `ref`) in `vendir.yml`.
2. Run `task vendir-sync`.
3. **cnpg only**: diff the file list under `crds/cloudnative-pg/upstream/` against the previous set; if upstream added or removed a CRD, update `crds/cloudnative-pg/kustomization.yaml` to match. cert-manager and gateway-api don't need this check — cert-manager is a single file, gateway-api uses upstream's own kustomization.yaml.
4. Verify: `kustomize build crds/` still emits the expected counts (as of cert-manager v1.21.0 / cnpg v1.30.0 / gateway-api v1.6.0: 27 CRDs + 2 HelmRepositories + 2 HelmReleases). This count grows when upstream adds CRDs — e.g. cnpg v1.30.0 added `databaseroles`, and gateway-api v1.6.0 graduated `backendtlspolicies`, `listenersets`, `tcproutes`, `tlsroutes`, `udproutes` into the standard channel. Run `yamllint .`.
5. `vendir.lock.yml` is auto-managed — commit it alongside the bump.

Note: prometheus-operator and temporal-worker-controller CRDs are NOT vendored — they come from dedicated Helm charts (`prometheus-operator-crds`, `temporal-worker-controller-crds`) declared as HelmReleases under `crds/`. Bumping those is a chart-version bump, no vendir involvement.

**Why:** cnpg's local `kustomization.yaml` is a hand-curated index of CRD files. If a new CNPG release adds a CRD and the index is not updated, that CRD silently won't deploy — the Flux pipeline does not fail-fast on this, it just renders fewer resources than expected.

**How to apply:** any time work touches a vendir-managed CRD (upgrading a tool's pinned version, refreshing the lockfile, debugging a missing CRD), follow the bump procedure above. Step 3 (cnpg index check) is the load-bearing one — skipping it is the realistic failure mode.
